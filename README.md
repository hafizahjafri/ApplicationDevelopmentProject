# UTM Gatherly 🧑🏻‍🎓

A website to manage events and clubs at UTM ✨

## Getting Started

We created a website to help UTM students easily find clubs and events on campus. This project simplifies the process of exploring, organizing, and participating in UTM activities.

This website is built using:
- A little template from [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) for event management.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and layout.

For further customization or to learn more about these tools, you can explore their documentation:
